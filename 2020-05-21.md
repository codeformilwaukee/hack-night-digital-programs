## We Need Your Help! Bi-Monthly Hack Events

**This Brigade is YOURS!**

Code for Milwaukee currently hosts one Hack Night per month, and we are getting a lot of interest to expand into a second event every month. We are considering hosting a second monthly event, perhaps more informal than the Hack Nights.

When might be a good time to have a second monthly event? Please tell us by filling out the survey at: https://forms.gle/oRmDMkzywKDLJJz86

Public health and public safety experts from across the country gather to d=

loss of life and mistrust of public authorities not just in violence preven=
tion, but also specifically in the present public health crisis. The panel =

2020 5:00PM - 6:00PM MDT

From everyday apps to complex algorithms, technology has the potential to h=
ide, speed, and deepen discrimination, while appearing neutral and even ben=
evolent when compared to racist practices of a previous era. In this talk, =
Ruha Benjamin explores a range of discriminatory designs that encode inequi=
ty: by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies, by ignoring but thereby re=
plicating social divisions, or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately =
doing quite the opposite.

r=E2=80=99s COVID-19 Response Initiative, a bipartisan group of experts in =
economics, public health, technology and ethics from across the country, ha=

As the old adage goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to re=
peat it. In this session, join NCWIT CEO and Co-founder Lucy Sanders explor=

 efforts. Lucy will also highlight an exciting, new research-based approach=
 for creating sustainable inclusive technical cultures=E2=80=94an approach =
that capitalizes on NCWIT=E2=80=99s decade-plus research and work with indu=
stry partners in this arena. This approach, called the Tech Inclusion Journ=

Statistics show that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in the =
United States are disproportionately impacted by COVID 19. This reality is =
not only true for health outcomes, but also for educational outcomes. Prior=
 to COVID 19, educational researchers recorded decades of evidence indicati=
ng that the U.S education system has inequitably served BIPOC students. The=
 pandemic will, and has most likely, already exacerbated these inequities. =
Leaders are being asked to reimagine what education will look like in the c=
oming months (and years) given the impact of the pandemic on schools. Often=
 missing from the policy discussions and budget cuts related to the pandemi=
c is an explicit focus on racial equity. Join the Roosevelt House as they d=
iscuss how we can reimagine education, considering both the possibilities a=
nd perils of this pandemic on achieving racial equity in schools.

Authoritarian leaders around the world are exploiting the coronavirus pande=
mic to concentrate powers, restrict civil liberties, weaken opposition righ=
ts, and undermine democratic checks and balances. Fighting the =E2=80=9Cinv=
isible enemy=E2=80=9D requires emergency powers, they argue, and democratic=

Bats have been identified by some experts, and in the media, as the culprit=
s behind the costliest pandemic in modern history, even though the source a=
nd method of transmission of the novel coronavirus remain unclear. Despite =
a long tradition of being misunderstood and feared, bats have an outstandin=
g record of living safely with humans. Exaggerated warnings of bat disease =
risks aren=E2=80=99t just misguided. They threaten the health of entire eco=
systems and economies. Join Merlin Tuttle, one of the world=E2=80=99s leadi=
ng bat scientists and conservation experts, to discuss the vital role bats =
play in ecosystems and how misplaced public health concerns are endangering=
 these important mammals.

The Midwest Mobility from Poverty Network is bringing together journalists =
and academic researchers from across the nation, with a focus on the Midwes=
t, for this virtual conference to promote in-depth, impactful, and solution=
s-oriented media coverage of poverty-related issues. The conference will co=
nsist of a series of six interactive webinars held throughout June.

While academic research contributes to a deeper understanding of poverty-re=
lated issues, the media is uniquely positioned to share those findings and =
shape how policymakers, community leaders, and the general public think abo=
ut poverty. Coverage of economic mobility issues is all the more urgent as =
income inequality in the U.S.  reached a record-high in 2019 [https://www.w=

demic has put new strains on our country=E2=80=99s social safety net.

This virtual conference is open to anyone interested in improving the narra=
tive around poverty in the U.S. =E2=80=93 from exploring new storytelling s=
trategies to translating complex research for deeper public engagement.
