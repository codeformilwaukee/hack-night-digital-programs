To create a new Digital Program, follow these steps:

# Create a new program

1. Navigate to the `archived_events` directory
2. Find the [template](https://github.com/codeformilwaukee/hack-night-digital-programs/blob/master/archived_events/template.md) for events
3. Create a new file in the `archived_events` directory with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. (feel free to use the template)
   - be sure to link to/from the Meetup event
   - Be sure to link to any slide deck or other materials
   - Maybe consider adding a place to link to our Youtube?
   
# Update links to the new program

In the Readme, under [Follow me to the digital program](https://github.com/codeformilwaukee/hack-night-digital-programs#follow-me-to-the-digital-program), change the link for the most recent program so that 
   1. the correct month is shown in text
   2. the link goes to the correct file (the new markdown doc that you just created)

# Verify that the list of all past programs is up to date

Also in the Readme, go down to [All Digital Programs](https://github.com/codeformilwaukee/hack-night-digital-programs#all-digital-programs) and add a new line for the most recent digital program (the new markdown doc that you just created)
