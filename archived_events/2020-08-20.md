## We Need Your Help! Bi-Monthly Hack Events

**This Brigade is YOURS!**

Code for Milwaukee currently hosts one Hack Night per month, and we are getting a lot of interest to expand into a second event every month. We are considering hosting a second monthly event, perhaps more informal than the Hack Nights.

When might be a good time to have a second monthly event? Please tell us by filling out the survey at: https://forms.gle/oRmDMkzywKDLJJz86

## Registered Breakout Groups

### Projects we know will be represented this evening:

### Other Code for Milwaukee Projects

### Starting a Breakout Group

Please keep in mind that any part of any project worked on at Code for Milwaukee must be focused on **improving civic services, delivery, and/or aspects of the Greater Milwaukee community** and **must be open-source**. These requirements only apply to Code for Milwaukee-sanctioned hack sessions.

To start a breakout group, please fill out the form located at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz46nBIBJDfCJFdp4jtpb_89gRtPoFpvgQxyxlywpW9OXtOg/viewform. If you do this during the Hack Night and before the breakout group introductions, please let a member of the Core Team know so you can be recognized and allowed to make an introduction.
